      I discovered my passion for technology while advocating for digital
      transformation at my previous role at a travel management company. I soon
      found myself fascinated with the world of tech, and my love for continuous
      learning led me to enroll in a Grace Hopper Software Engineering
      immersive. Today, I successfully transitioned from a project
      manager/account executive to a fullstack developer. As a developer, I
      leverage my past customer centric experiences to build visually pleasing
      and user friendly apps.

    my mother's family lives. I learned about American culture and English
    language in Portland, Oregon. And I was able to reconnect with my Dominican
    roots through my father's side of family when I moved to New York after
    graduating from college. */}
