  <p>
    Hi! I'm Natalie Rojas, a fullstack software developer based in Jersey City.
    <br />I love the ability to build creative apps that solves problems. I'm a
    fullstack developer and UI/UX enthusiast. My interest in technology came
    from when
    <br />
    <br />I was originally born and spent my childhood in Fukuoka, Japan, where
    my mother's family lives. I learned about American culture and English
    language in Portland, Oregon. And I was able to reconnect with my Dominican
    roots through my father's side of family when I moved to New York after
    graduating from college. When I'm not coding or daydreaming about my next
    project, I like to watch Ghibili movies, drink tea, and reading historical
    fantasy books.
